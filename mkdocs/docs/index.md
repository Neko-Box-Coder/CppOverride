Cpp Override is a C++ 11 Framework that allows you to override function behaviors. 

This allows testing in a per function basis instead of being forced to use classes, 
though you can still use this framework to perform mocking in the traditional OOP way.

We even ship with a mock class generator which parses a given header and gives back mock class you
can use.

Using the framework is very simple, after you declare an override instance, you just need to follow
the "Insert, Instruct, Inspect" steps to setup and test your overridden functions.

**🚀 Features**

- ⚙️ Override any classes you want, including **non virtual classes**
- 💡 Override any functions you want, including **free functions**
- 📑 Doesn't break **C++ Standard**, no need to exploit vtable
- 🔌 Easy to setup and use
- 🔋 Batteries included, generate mock classes using the mock class generator
